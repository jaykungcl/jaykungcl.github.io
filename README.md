## Homepage

This is my first ever homepage!!!
It is built as a course project in Harvard's CS50x Introduction to Computer Science.

HarvardX Project Description: https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/fall/psets/8/homepage/

I spent time learning, experimenting and researching very deeply into various CSS/JS tricks before I went on creating this project.

This is a space where I showed off my creativity, ideas, and interesting CSS/JS tricks.
